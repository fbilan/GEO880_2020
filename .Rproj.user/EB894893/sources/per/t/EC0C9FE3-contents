The Metro Bike Share data set needed some additional pre-processing. Trips below 1 minute and capping trips at 24 hours have been removed from the dataset by Metro Bike Share. We have decided to remove trips below 3 minutes and above 1440 minutes (24 hours) since they can be assumed to be bikes that were returned before usage (e.g. due to damage) or unreturned bikes respectively. Additionally, we have removed trips that had missing coordinates.

As shown in Figure 1, the bike stations are clustered in four areas of the city with the following centers of the clusters: Downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Long Beach and Valley Village. With the exception of only 3 trips in the dataset, the trips take place within a cluster (have the same start and end cluster). The clusters were defined by filtering the stations by their coordinate values. A different approach by using a well known clustering method, such as DBSCAN could also have been used. But because the clusters are very clear, the filtering approach does not lead to a different result.  

We would like to note that all methods could be applied to the other clusters and other similar datasets of other cities as well. We have then adjusted data types in the dataset for further usage and tidied up column descriptions such as “start_day” or “end_hour” for a better overall view. After transforming the data to the NAD83 coordinate system, we calculated the trip distance by using pythagoras between the start and end stations. Afterwards, we could calculate the (average) velocity for each trip by using the distance and the trip duration. The values were added to the dataset.  

We have decided to focus on the Downtown Los Angeles (see Figure 1). This cluster includes the majority of trips (83%) and stations (57%). The table below shows absolute numbers. The average trip duration is 20.5 minutes and the average trip distance is 1.3 kilometers (linear distance excluding round trips where the distance is zero). The monthly pass is the most common passholder type with 72%. 18% of trips are of the type “Walk-up” and only 10% of the trips can be ascribed to other passholder types (annual, one day, and flex pass).

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
